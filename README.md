## Running the development server

1. Ensure you have [Node JS](https://nodejs.org) installed. 
Node 6.9.x and npm 3.x.x are required to run this project. 
We recommend installing Node 8.10.0.

2. Install Angular CLI globally, using `npm install -g @angular/cli`.

3. Run `npm install` and wait for the dependencies to install. \
If you encounter errors, ensure that you're running a compatible version of Node JS.

4. Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
